code documentation for the provided Flask application:

## Project Overview
This project is a Flask web application that allows users to convert currencies. It provides a simple user interface where users can enter an amount, select the source currency, and select the target currency. The application then uses the `convert` function from the `conv` module to perform the currency conversion and displays the result on the results page.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: A web framework for Python that allows us to build web applications.
- HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS: Used for styling the web pages.
- Jinja2: A templating engine used in Flask to dynamically generate HTML pages.

## Code Explanation
1. The Flask application is created and an instance of the `Flask` class is created with the name `app`.
2. The `/` route is defined using the `@app.route` decorator. It simply renders the `index.html` template, which serves as the homepage of the application.
3. The `/results` route is defined with the `methods=['GET', 'POST']` parameter, indicating that it can handle both GET and POST requests. This route is responsible for processing the currency conversion form.
4. Inside the `/results` route, we first check if the request method is POST.
5. If the method is POST, we retrieve the amount, source currency, and target currency from the form submitted by the user.
6. The `convert` function is called from the `conv` module, passing in the amount, source currency (converted to lowercase), and target currency.
7. The result, along with other relevant information, is stored in the `info` list.
8. The `info` list is passed to the `result.html` template, where the result and other information are displayed.
9. If the method is not POST (i.e., a GET request), the function simply renders the `result.html` template without any information.
10. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the Flask application is only run if the script is executed directly and not imported as a module.

## Instructions to Run and Test the Website
To run and test the website, follow these steps:

1. Install Flask if you haven't already. You can install it by running the command `pip install flask` in your command prompt or terminal.
2. Save the provided code into a Python file, for example, `currency_converter.py`.
3. Create a new Python file named `conv.py` and implement the `convert` function that performs the currency conversion. Make sure to import any necessary libraries or APIs for currency conversion.
4. Create an `index.html` file that serves as the homepage and a `result.html` file to display the conversion results. Customize these files as per your requirements, including form elements, styling, and result display.
5. In the same directory where you saved the Python files and HTML templates, open a command prompt or terminal.
6. Run the Flask application by executing the command `python currency_converter.py`.
7. You will see some output indicating that the Flask application is running.
8. Open a web browser and enter the URL `http://localhost:5000` to access the homepage of the currency converter application.
9. Enter the required details in the form, submit it, and verify that the conversion result is displayed correctly on the results page.
10. Test the application with different inputs to ensure its accuracy and functionality.
